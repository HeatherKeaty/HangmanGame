Hangman ReadMe

This program: 
This program is designed so a user can play hangman against the computer. The program choses a word at random from a preset list of words. User will continue to enter guesses until they run out of guess, 6 turns to reflect the graphic version of the game, or until you win the game by guessing the word correctly. 

How the program runs/rules:
1. Open the HangmanGame folder, inside there should be two files, Hangman.py & words.txt

2. Open the Hangman.py file, leave the words.txt file alone. 

3. Run the Hangman.py file.

4. The program will select a word at random from the words.txt file and print out underscores that will show how many letters the word contains. 
 
5. Enter your first guess, the program will tell you if the letter is in the word or not.

6. If your guess is wrong, you will lose a turn, which will display on screen. If your guess if right, the letter will show in the correct space in the blanks. 

7. You will be prompted to continue the game until you get the word right, or until you run out of guesses. If you enter a guess you’ve previously guessed, the program will remind you that you’ve guessed the letter already, and prompt you enter a different one. 

8. The game ends when you either win or lose. 

9. The user will be asked if they would like to repeat the game, it will allow you to exit if you do not. 


Notes on the program:
The program preforms how we were hoping it would. We spent about 35 hours on the creation of this game, working together through emails and meetings after classes. All sections of the code were written individually and then reworked as a team.
